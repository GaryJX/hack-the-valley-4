With one exception: George Washington. That's important. Mary Washington lost her parents in young age, and then she lost her husband. In order to understand Washington, you need to understand that. That was George Washington's experience in the war. Washington was a spymaster, he understood propaganda. Remember, Washington was essentially the head of his household at the age of 10. Washington did not see enslaved people as equal to white people. Coe: One, he wasn't freeing slaves outright. His slaves and hers had married, they had had children together. Washington knew that Martha was not going to emancipate her own family's slaves. We're talking about 300 people, 123 people who belong to Washington and are free to go. Coe: It's interesting to me that Washington's biographers have fixated on his childlessness. He was fathering hard. Martha Washington was not very interested in politics. We don't know if Washington asked her to do this, but it definitely was the norm. We've still found a few letters, though. That didn't happen. Not just in time, but in practice. Coe: It's funny. There's a silhouette, and a bobble-head. Also, I promised my husband no more Washington.\"}"
