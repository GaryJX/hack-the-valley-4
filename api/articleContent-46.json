At a cursory glance, it looks almost normal: There's the familiar jut of Florida, the Great Lakes, Mexico and South America. Idaho is, too. Nobody even wants to hear about Ohio 1,\\\" she said. Despite it being home to the Rocky Mountains and Yellowstone National Park, Anna doubts that it is real. \\\"Nothing against Wyoming, it just doesn't exist,\\\" she said. But oh, we haven't even touched the rest of the Americas. In Anna's twisted world, the Chilean-American War that results from Chile effectively stealing the Pacific Ocean is the catalyst of World War III.\"}"
