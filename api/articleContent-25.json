The New York Police Department responded to the historic Broadhurst Theatre around 4:15 p.m. Saturday after receiving a call about a suspicious substance, authorities said. When she went over to investigate, her eyes began watering and she showed other symptoms consistent with pepper spray exposure. She alerted security, which evacuated the theater, the NYPD said. When police arrived, a large group of audience members was gathered out on the sidewalk. The New York City Fire Department entered the theater and determined it was likely pepper spray that had been released. The episode remains under investigation. No arrests have been made. The musical debuted in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2018 and opened on Broadway in December 2019. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.\"}"
