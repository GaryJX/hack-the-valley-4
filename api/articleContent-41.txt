"Congrats manda! who is the lucky man?" another asked.  Bynes rose to fame in the '90s on shows including "All That" and "The Amanda Show."  Her career continued to flourish as she starred in hit movies such as "She's the Man" and "What a Girl Wants" in the 2000s.  But in 2012, she made headlines for a series of arrests and drug use.  She opened up two years ago about her troubles, telling Paper magazine that she's now sober. Bynes said she eventually hopes to get back into acting.
