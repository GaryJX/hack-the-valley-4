He went on unchallenged to win the fourth race of the season. In trying to defend his position, Lotterer was pushed out on to the grass and, consequently, to fifth. The Porsche driver failed to finish the race, smashing into the wall on the exit of Turn 3 with the corner of the car then catching fire. \\\"It's nice to have don't get me wrong, but it's still way too early. Things can change pretty quick, so I'm not going to get too far ahead of myself.\\\" DS Techeetah's Antonio Felix da Costa finished 4.271 seconds behind in second, while Nissan e.dams' Sebastien Buemi came third as he took advantage of the rear of Nyck de Vries' car snapping. Evans leads the overall standings by a point. BMW iAndretti's Alexander Sims moves to second, while De Costa is third. Fourteen drivers failed to finish the race. Mercedes' Stoffel Vandoorne was one, hitting the wall at the exit of Turn 3, which meant he failed to score for the first time this season and drops to fourth in the championship.\"}"
